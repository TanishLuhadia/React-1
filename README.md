This example demonstrates key React concepts using both functional and class components:

1. Functional Component (`AppExample1`):
   - `useRef` Hook:
     - Used to create a reference to a class component (`AboutMe`). This allows direct interaction with the `AboutMe` component instance, such as calling its methods.
   - Event Handling:
     - A button triggers the `goToNextDomain` function, which uses the ref to call `updateDomain` on the `AboutMe` component to update its state.

2. Class Component (`AboutMe`):
   - State Management:
     - Manages internal state with `this.state` and initializes it from props. Provides a method (`updateDomain`) to update the state.
   - Rendering:
     - Renders the current state values (`domain` and `motto`).

3. Interaction Between Components:
   - Refs:
     - `ref` is used to access and interact with the `AboutMe` class component from the `AppExample1` function component.
   - Props and State:
     - `AboutMe` receives `domain` and `motto` as props and maintains them in its state, demonstrating how props are used to initialize state and how state can be updated.

This example shows how to integrate functional and class components, manage state and refs, and handle events in a React application.
